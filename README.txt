******************************INTRODUCTION*******************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Main menu has three buttons called 'Display', 'Trash' and 'Exit'.
Display will bring up a table that displays famous computer scientists,
famous computers and links between them, depending on the tab chosen 
and buttons that can affect each list in the chosen tab. Changing tabs 
can be done at the top of the window in 'Person', 'Computer' or 'Links'.
Each display has a search option, sorting option and each display table 
has the buttons 'Add', 'Edit', 'Delete' and 'Back'.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Search

Search option is available in all the display tables. A drop down menu 
implies what to search for. The search will commense when the 'Search' 
button is clicked. *Searhing will also work on substrings*.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Sort

Sorting a display table can be done by clicking on the column header and
works both in an ascending and descending order.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add

Clicking this button will bring up an add menu depending on which 
display table was open previously.

	1. Add Person
   This menu requires the user to input name, year of birth, gender,
   death year (if applicable) and the extra options of year they 
   have won a Turing award and their contribution to the world of 
   computer science. If any information has been input incorrectly 
   an error label will show which part it is upon clicking the 'Add' 
   button.
   If the information has all been correctly input then a message
   box will display 'Added successfully'. Finally the 'Back' button
   is an option to cancel and bring back the display menu.

	2. Add Computer
   Adding computer is similar to adding a person but it has fewer
   input fields: name, type and year built (if applicable).
   The same will happen as in the add person menu when entering the 
   information and clicking 'Add' or 'Back'.

	3. Add Link
   This brings up a menu where the user can see a list of people 
   and computers to make a link between them. The user can either 
   input the ID's of either one or choose them from the list.
   If only one is chosen an error message is displayed, otherwise
   the link will have been added successfully, unless the ID input
   does not exist.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Edit

The edit button will become available to click when an item in the list
has been clicked on and highlighted. *This is not the case for links*.
When editing an item, the edit menus are similar to the add menus for
each item and will display the information already input. The user can
then choose which part he wants to change and clik on 'Edit' to make the
changes. Similar to the add menus, an error message will appear if any
of the input is unacceptable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Delete

Deleting will become optionable upon clicking on and highlighting an
item in the list. When highlighted, clicking on delete will immdeiately
move the item clicked on to the trash bin *the trash bin is accessible
from the Main menu*. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Trash Bin

This menu contains deleted items from the display lists and opts to
restore them. It will display a table similar to the display window, 
without the search, sort, add and edit functions. Emptying the trash
bin is also an option and will delete all of the items displayed in each 
table in the trash bin.
